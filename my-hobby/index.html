      <p class="text-one">I'm Victoria, and I love sewing for my two whippets. Being a creative person, I find joy in
        crafting clothes and accessories for my furry companions. Whether it's making cozy sweaters for chilly days or
        stylish coats for walks in the park, sewing for my dogs is not just a hobby but a way for me to express my
        creativity while ensuring they're comfortable and fashionable. It's a simple pleasure that brings me closer to
        my pets and allows me to indulge in my passion for crafting.

        An additional hobby is photography, something that comes in handy when wanting to document my creations.

        Whippets need clothing to keep them warm during the chilly months. Their thin fur isn't always enough to protect
        them from the cold, so I take it upon myself to ensure they're snug and cozy. Additionally, finding harnesses
        that fit their unique body shape can be a challenge. Standard sizes often don't accommodate their slender frames
        and deep chests properly. That's why I've taken to sewing custom harnesses tailored specifically for them. It's
        a labor of love, knowing that I'm providing them with the warmth and comfort they need while also ensuring their
        safety and mobility.
